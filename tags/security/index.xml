      <description>A surprisingly relevant image. (ty James for finding this &amp;lt;3)
  Climbing Mount Kilimanjaro is no easy feat. Seriously. I&amp;rsquo;ve no doubt that unless you&amp;rsquo;re some type of mountain sherpa, you&amp;rsquo;d agree with me on that one. However, I&amp;rsquo;d like to paint a slightly different perspective, with references, of course.
The Kilimanjaro climb consists of 2 main parts: the trail, and the high camp.
 The time on the trail, including lunch and rest breaks, averages around six hours per day.</description>
